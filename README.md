# cpython-ita
This work is group project of the Pisa CoderDojo and a batch of computer science students. Here, we fork the Cpython repository, and we extended the grammar of Python languange in order to use italian keyworks as native constructor. Furthermore,
to fully integrate the new keys, we modified the language interpreter is some parts, such as: the EBNF grammar (i.e. adding new production), the AST (abstract syntax tree), and the builtin funtions. In addiction, we modified the standard
IDLE to have an editor that highlight and hints the new added words. This project has been presented in the keynote of [Toscana DojoCon](https://coderdojo.com/news/2016/06/21/toscana-dojocon/), and it will
be use for educations purpose as toy programming language. We will continue to improve the language syntax in order to let it become more suitable for coding teaching.
